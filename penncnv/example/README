This directory contains some example files to run PennCNV, assuming that PennCNV is already installed in the system and that the executables are already in the system PATH environmental variable.

The runex.pl script can be issued to run sample sessions:

The user can run these programs sequentially:

perl runex.pl 1

perl runex.pl 2
	
perl runex.pl 3

......

perl runex.pl 16

If PennCNV is not set up in the PATH environmental variable, the user need to add '-path_detect_cnv ../detect_cnv.pl' argument to the above commands.

If there is any problem running the examples, or if the output files differ from those in the output_expected/ directory, it may indcate that PennCNV is not installed correctly.
